# Fast React Pizza 🍕

A modern pizza ordering web application built with React, showcasing advanced state management, routing, and styling practices. This project was designed as part of my transition from Vue to React, with a strong focus on app architecture, performance, and scalability. It demonstrates my ability to handle complex UI and remote states, manage asynchronous flows, and build user-centric experiences.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic pizza menu fetched from an API
- Add one or multiple pizzas to a cart before checkout
- Place orders with name, phone number, address, and optional GPS location
- Mark orders as "priority" for an additional 20% fee, even after placing the order
- View your order by its unique ID
- No user login required, just input your name

## 📄 Pages

- `/` : Homepage
- `/menu` : Pizza Menu

## 📦 API Integration

- Pizza menu and order submission are handled through API calls (GET for menu, POST for new orders)
